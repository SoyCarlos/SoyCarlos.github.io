By day, I work as a <a class="font-bold">Data Engineer</a> @ <a href="https://www.entidad.io/" target="_blank" class="underline font-bold">Entidad</a>. By night, I'm helping launch <a href="https://openpatterson.org/" target="_blank" class="font-bold underline">Open Patterson</a>, a <a href="https://brigade.codeforamerica.org/" target="_blank" class="underline">Code for America Brigade</a>. Besides that, I am currently obsessed with prosciutto and burrata on toasted sourdough bread.
<br>
<br>
I was born and raised in <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Patterson%2C_California" target="_blank" class="underline">Patterson, CA.</a> A small rural-ish town with a love for Apricots and Roundabouts. I graduated from Patterson High School in 2016.  
<br>
After completing high school, I went on to study at <a class="font-bold">UC Berkeley</a>, receiving my <a class="font-bold">Bachelors in Cognitive Science</a> in 2021. Originally, planning to study Computer Science, <a class="font-bold">I fell in love with Data</a> after taking the Foundations of Data Science course my first semester. I spent the next few years heavily involed in the Data Science community, as well as the media community through CalTV.
<br><br>
In the last few years, I have sought out to explore many of the different uses of data: <a class="font-bold">Data Education</a> (<a href="http://data8.org/fa17/staff.html#Tutors" target="_blank" class="underline">Data 8</a> and <a href="https://data.berkeley.edu/academics/campus-resources/data-peer-consulting" target="_blank" class="underline">Data Peer Consulting</a>), <a class="font-bold">Politics</a> (2 Political Campaigns through <a href="https://www.bluebonnetdata.org/" target="_blank" class="underline">Bluebonnet Data</a>), <a class="font-bold">Government</a> (<a href="https://blog.codingitforward.com/meet-the-2019-fellows-u-s-census-bureau-52b87c481bb1" target="_blank" class="underline">Civic Digital Fellowship @ U.S. Census Bureau</a>, <a href="https://github.com/codingitforward/cdfdemoday2019/blob/master/Automating_Frame_Maintenance_and_Frame_Matching.pdf" target="_blank" class="underline">Project</a>), <a class="font-bold">Health</a> (NLP x Gastrointestinal Research through UCSF and <a href="https://data.berkeley.edu/discovery" target="_blank" class="underline">UC Berkeley Data Discovery</a>), and <a class="font-bold">Social Impact</a> through my current role.

The best way to reach me is by <a href="mailto:me@carlos.soy" target="_blank" class="font-bold underline">email</a>. I'm always happy to chat about possible collaborations, as well as give advice to any younger folks. I know it can be hard breaking into tech while being first-generation and underrepresented in the industry.
