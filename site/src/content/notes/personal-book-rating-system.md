## ⭐ 1 Star
I hated it. Or maybe I just couldn’t get into it at all. Honestly, it might be a good book for someone else—but definitely not for me.
## ⭐⭐ 2 Stars
It had its moments, and I could see what the author was going for. But overall? Still not my thing. Again, maybe it’s just me.
## ⭐⭐⭐ 3 Stars
I enjoyed it while it lasted, but it’s not something I’d go back to. A solid “one-and-done” kind of book.
## ⭐⭐⭐⭐ 4 Stars
I really liked this one! It’s the kind of book I’d happily revisit, even recommend to a friend.
## ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐ 5 Stars
I _loved_ this book. It hit me in all the right ways, and it felt as close to perfect as a book can get. That said, 5-star ratings are rare for me—they’re usually tied to a book hitting at just the right time in my life or stirring up some serious nostalgia. If I’d read it at a different point, who knows? But for now, it’s pure magic.
