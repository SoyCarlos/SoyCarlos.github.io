Hi! I'm Carlos Ortega, a Software Engineer and Data Analyst from ***[California's Central Valley](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Central_Valley_(California))***. By day, I am working on freelance projects and ***[Civvy](https://www.civvy.ai/).*** By night, I work on ***[Open Patterson](https://www.openpatterson.org/)***, a volunteer civic tech initiative working on independent projects for the community and partnering with local nonprofits.
